        <h1 id="about-heading">Hello. We're Scoper. A property website.</h1>
        <h2 id="about-main">
            We know you're not just looking for a place to live. You're looking for a home.
            Yeah, we've got plenty of properties for you to browse and reliable house price estimates, so you can be sure you aren't paying over the odds.
        </h2>
            <h2 id="about-main-last-parag">But we know you're looking for more than that, because that first flat won't just be a 'great investment opportunity', it'll be the feeling of starting out on your own.
            That extra bedroom won't just mean another £20K on the re-sale price, it'll mean having your brother over to stay.
            And that bungalow won't just be a way to release some equity, it will be a chance to spend more time with the grandkids.
            We know that searching for a home is about more than just checking its price, location and features (important as all those things are).
            What really matters is how it makes you feel, we know what a home is really worth so let us help you find yours.</h2>
